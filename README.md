rootbeer
========

A static-file markdown wiki written in Ruby and powered by Sinatra.

Why am I making rootbeer?
-------------------------
My current solution of taking notes in markdown has been working great, but as I keep making more and more note files I'm quickly realizing I need more structure and the ability to link to different note pages. rootbeer is my answer to this dilemma withought having to sacrifice my current markdown + git solution.
